              Welcome to our project! This single-page application is crafted with React and Vite, delivering a seamless and interactive user experience. It serves as a dynamic showcase for an extensive collection of art data.

            <p>
              The platform integrates comprehensive details about galleries, artists, genres, and paintings, all sourced directly from Supabase. It leverages modern web development practices, including RESTful API integration, client-side routing with React Router, dynamic state management, and responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

            <p>
              Designed with both aesthetics and functionality in mind, the application offers an intuitive navigation experience. Users can explore various art categories and easily save their favorites for quick access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developed for COMP 4513, this project also serves as a portfolio piece, showcasing advanced skills in React, API integration, and contemporary UI/UX design principles.
